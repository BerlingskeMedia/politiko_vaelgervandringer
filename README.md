## Contribute

First off you need to download this repo and all its dependencies:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/tcarlsen/voter-transitions && cd voter-transitions
$ npm install && bower install
```

Second, this app needs a locale proxy for the get requests from berlingske to work

```bash
$ npm install -g corsproxy
$ corsproxy
```

Lets fire this baby up by running the `gulp` script! :fire:

Lastly, now navigate to the new `app` folder and start your local server
